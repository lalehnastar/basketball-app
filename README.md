 App logic:
---  
An app that provides users to sign up and get information about teams, team details and players.
Each user can add a new team to the list, can edit or delete a team. The user can also click on each team to see the logo, name and number of the players in each team. Clicking on players option in the navbar gives users the details of each player such as fullname, height and weight. Users can use the log in option if they are already a member.
